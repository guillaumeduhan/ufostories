On November 17, 1986, Japan Airlines Flight 1628, a cargo flight en route from Paris to Tokyo, encountered a massive unidentified object while flying over Alaska. The experienced crew, including Captain Kenju Terauchi, reported a glowing, walnut-shaped object that paced their Boeing 747 for nearly 50 minutes.

The crew described two smaller craft and a larger mothership-like object, which they said was “twice the size of an aircraft carrier.” The UFOs were observed visually and confirmed on FAA and military radar, prompting immediate concern.

Captain Terauchi’s credibility as a seasoned pilot drew public and media attention. The FAA conducted an investigation, and the incident was later referenced in official documents. However, the captain was grounded by Japan Airlines shortly afterward, allegedly for causing a media storm.

Despite official skepticism, the Japan Airlines 1628 encounter remains one of the most detailed and corroborated UFO incidents involving commercial aviation.
