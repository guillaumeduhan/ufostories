*Still from video footage of the Greifswald Lights — August 1990*

On August 24, 1990, dozens of glowing orbs were seen hovering and maneuvering in formation over the city of Greifswald, in what was then East Germany. The lights remained visible for nearly an hour and were witnessed by civilians, soldiers, and pilots — many of whom recorded the event.

Multiple videos and photographs showed bright, spherical lights forming geometric patterns in the sky before disappearing one by one. Some observers initially believed the lights were military flares, but their extended duration, unusual behavior, and the calm weather conditions raised doubts.

The East German and Soviet militaries were active in the area at the time, leading some to speculate that the lights were part of a classified exercise. However, no official explanation was ever released, and military sources denied responsibility.

With its combination of mass public observation, photographic evidence, and lack of clear origin, the Greifswald Lights remain one of Europe’s most intriguing UFO events.
