On July 8, 1947, the Roswell Army Air Field issued a press release stating they had recovered a "flying disc" from a ranch near Roswell, New Mexico. The next day, the military retracted the statement, claiming the debris was from a weather balloon. This sudden reversal sparked widespread speculation and conspiracy theories.

Decades later, in the 1970s, interest in the incident resurfaced when researchers interviewed witnesses who claimed the debris was not from a balloon but something more extraordinary. Some accounts even mentioned the recovery of alien bodies, fueling further intrigue.

The U.S. Air Force released reports in the 1990s attributing the incident to Project Mogul, a top-secret program involving high-altitude balloons designed to detect Soviet nuclear tests. However, skeptics argue that this explanation doesn't account for all eyewitness testimonies.

The Roswell Incident remains one of the most debated UFO cases in history, symbolizing the tension between government secrecy and public curiosity about extraterrestrial life.
