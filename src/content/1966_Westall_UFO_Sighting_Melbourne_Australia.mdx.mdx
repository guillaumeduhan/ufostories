*Westall UFO Sighting 1966 — Melbourne, Australia*

On April 6, 1966, more than 200 students and staff at Westall High School in Melbourne witnessed a silver, disc-shaped object hover, land, and then quickly take off over nearby Grange Reserve. The event lasted about 20 minutes, with the object seen by numerous independent observers.

Local media covered the story extensively, but government officials quickly dismissed the event as a weather balloon. Witnesses have since spoken about being told not to discuss the sighting, fueling speculation of a cover-up.

To this day, the Westall UFO remains Australia's most famous mass UFO sighting, with reunions held by witnesses still convinced of what they saw.
