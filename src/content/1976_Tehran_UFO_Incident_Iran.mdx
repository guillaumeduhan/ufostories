*Tehran UFO Incident 1976 — Tehran, Iran*

On September 19, 1976, the Iranian Air Force scrambled two F-4 Phantom II jets to intercept an unidentified object seen over Tehran. As the pilots approached the luminous craft, their weapons and instrumentation systems malfunctioned, forcing them to retreat.

The encounter was extensively documented in a classified U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) report, which highlighted the case as highly credible. The pilots reported the object displayed extraordinary maneuverability and emitted smaller objects.

The Tehran Incident remains one of the best-documented military UFO encounters, with international recognition of its significance.
