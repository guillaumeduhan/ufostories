*Pascagoula Abduction 1973 — Artistic depiction of the encounter*

On the evening of October 11, 1973, coworkers Charles Hickson and Calvin Parker were fishing on the Pascagoula River in Mississippi when they reported a harrowing encounter. According to their account, a glowing object descended nearby, and they were taken aboard by strange robotic-like beings.

The men described the entities as humanoid with wrinkled skin, claw-like hands, and carrot-shaped heads. After a brief medical examination aboard the craft, they were returned to the riverbank in a dazed state.

When they reported the incident to the local sheriff, a secret recording captured them speaking privately about the event, seemingly terrified — a detail that strengthened their credibility. The story gained national attention and became a focal point in abduction research.

Despite skepticism and ridicule, both Hickson and Parker maintained their account for decades. In later years, new witnesses came forward claiming to have seen unusual lights that night, adding weight to their testimony.

The Pascagoula Abduction remains one of the most compelling and well-documented alien abduction stories in the United States.
