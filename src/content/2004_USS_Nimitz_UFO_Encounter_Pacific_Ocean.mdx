*USS Nimitz UFO Encounter 2004 — FLIR Footage*

In November 2004, pilots from the USS Nimitz Carrier Strike Group encountered an unidentified flying object off the coast of Southern California. The object, described as a white, oval-shaped "Tic Tac," exhibited flight capabilities beyond known technology.

Commander David Fravor and Lieutenant Commander Jim Slaight observed the object performing rapid ascents, descents, and hovering with no visible means of propulsion. Attempts to intercept the object were unsuccessful, as it outmaneuvered their aircraft with ease.

The incident was captured on FLIR (Forward-Looking Infrared) footage and later declassified by the Pentagon. The videos sparked significant interest and debate within both military and civilian communities.

This encounter is considered one of the most credible UFO sightings due to the professionalism of the witnesses and the availability of multiple forms of evidence, including radar data and video footage.
