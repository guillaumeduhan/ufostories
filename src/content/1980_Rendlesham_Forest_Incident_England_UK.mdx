*Rendlesham Forest UFO Incident 1980 — Suffolk, UK*

In late December 1980, U.S. Air Force personnel stationed at RAF Woodbridge and RAF Bentwaters in Suffolk, England, reported seeing strange lights in Rendlesham Forest. On December 26, several servicemen investigated and encountered a metallic triangular craft moving through the trees.

Deputy base commander Lt. Col. Charles Halt later recorded an official memorandum and an audio tape describing the events. Multiple witnesses reported unusual radiation readings and a sighting of a glowing object ascending into the sky.

The British Ministry of Defence eventually labeled the case as posing "no threat to national security," but it remains one of the UK's most famous and credible UFO encounters.
