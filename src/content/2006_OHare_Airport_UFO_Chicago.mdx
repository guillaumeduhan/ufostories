On November 7, 2006, United Airlines employees and pilots at Chicago O’Hare International Airport witnessed a metallic, disc-shaped object hovering silently over Gate C17. The sighting occurred in broad daylight and lasted several minutes before the object shot vertically through the clouds, leaving a visible hole.

At least a dozen witnesses described the same phenomenon, including ramp workers, mechanics, and supervisors. Despite their detailed reports, the FAA initially dismissed the event, claiming it was a “weather phenomenon” and did not investigate.

However, following media pressure and a FOIA request, the FAA released internal recordings confirming that the sighting had been reported by multiple credible sources. The event became one of the most compelling modern UFO incidents due to its location — one of the busiest airports in the U.S. — and the professionalism of the witnesses.

To this day, no official explanation has been provided for the object’s presence or its sudden disappearance.
