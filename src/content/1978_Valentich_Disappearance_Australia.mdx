*Frederick Valentich and the aircraft he piloted before vanishing*

On October 21, 1978, 20-year-old Australian pilot Frederick Valentich vanished while flying a Cessna 182L over the Bass Strait. Before disappearing, he made a chilling radio call to air traffic control, describing a large, unknown object hovering above him and behaving erratically.

In his final transmission, Valentich said, *“It’s not an aircraft... it’s hovering, and it’s not an aircraft.”* Seconds later, a metallic scraping sound was heard, and all communication ceased. No trace of Valentich or his plane was ever found.

The incident sparked national and international intrigue. Some believe he staged his own disappearance, while others point to disorientation or mechanical failure. However, UFO enthusiasts cite his calm demeanor, consistent story, and the radar detection of an unidentified object in the area as evidence of something otherworldly.

The Valentich Disappearance remains one of aviation's great unsolved mysteries — a case that straddles the line between UFO lore and real-world aviation tragedy.
