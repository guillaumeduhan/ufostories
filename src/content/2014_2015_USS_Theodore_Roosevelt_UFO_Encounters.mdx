*Infrared footage from the GIMBAL encounter recorded by U.S. Navy pilots*

Between 2014 and 2015, U.S. Navy fighter pilots operating from the USS *Theodore Roosevelt* off the East Coast reported a series of encounters with unidentified aerial phenomena (UAPs). These objects displayed no visible means of propulsion, performed rapid accelerations, and flew at altitudes and speeds far beyond conventional aircraft.

Two key pieces of infrared footage — later dubbed **GIMBAL** and **GOFAST** — were captured using FLIR cameras and released by the Pentagon in 2017 and 2020. In the videos, pilots can be heard reacting in real time as they track fast-moving, unidentified objects with advanced sensors.

The encounters led to internal Navy policy changes for reporting UAPs and were central to renewed congressional interest in UFOs. Pilots involved described the objects as “dark cubes inside clear spheres,” with some flying in formation or remaining stationary in high winds.

These sightings became part of the U.S. government's public acknowledgment of unexplained aerial encounters, marking a historic shift in how such phenomena are addressed.
