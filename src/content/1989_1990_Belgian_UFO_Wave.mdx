Beginning on the night of November 29, 1989, a wave of UFO sightings swept across Belgium. Hundreds of witnesses, including police officers and military personnel, described seeing large, silent, triangular-shaped objects with bright lights hovering or moving slowly through the sky.

One of the most well-documented events occurred in March 1990, when two F-16 fighter jets were scrambled by the Belgian Air Force to intercept unknown radar targets. Although the pilots couldn’t visually confirm the objects, their instruments recorded highly unusual flight maneuvers, including rapid altitude changes.

The Belgian Gendarmerie compiled dozens of detailed reports, and the government took the sightings seriously, with the Air Force later releasing a formal analysis. A now-famous photograph of a triangular craft, though later admitted to be a hoax, captured the imagination of the public.

Despite intense investigation, no conclusive explanation emerged. The Belgian UFO Wave is often cited as one of the most credible and coordinated UFO phenomena in modern history.
