On the night of April 30, 2023, a bright object streaked across the sky over Las Vegas and was captured on multiple police bodycams. Moments later, a local family called 911 reporting that something had landed in their backyard — and that “non-human beings” were standing around 8 to 10 feet tall with glowing eyes.

The incident gained national attention when the Las Vegas Metro Police Department released the 911 call and footage showing officers arriving on scene visibly unsettled. Despite a search of the area, no beings or craft were found, but a circular impression in the ground added to the mystery.

Skeptics argued it was a hoax or misidentified natural event, but believers pointed to the synchronized timing between the crash, visual evidence, and eyewitness descriptions as compelling. The proximity to Area 51 only fueled public intrigue.

Though no conclusive explanation emerged, the Las Vegas Backyard Sighting became one of the most widely discussed and viral UFO-related events in recent years.
